\title{Generates a UMPGA hierarchical clustered tibble of Mash sequences based on given threshold from 0 to 1.}
\usage{
cluster_list_gen(cutoff)
}
\arguments{
\item{cutoff}{The mash distance cutoff for hierarchical clustering, from 0 to 1. cutoff=0 means sequences will be divided when their mash distance is above 0. cutoff >=1 means all sequences will form one cluster.}
}
\value{
A clustering list (tibble). The first column is the mash sequences in original order, the second column is the assigned cluster bases on given cutoff.
}
